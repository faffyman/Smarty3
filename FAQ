TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

Q: Smarty doesn't work.
A: You must be using PHP 4.0.4pl1 or later to fix all known problems
   Smarty has with PHP. Read the BUGS section of the documentation.

Q: Smarty is recompiling my templates on every invocation.
A: This is a bug that was fixed in 1.0a, grab the latest tarball.

Q: I get the following error when running Smarty:
   Warning: Wrong parameter count for preg_replace() in
   Smarty.class.php on line 371
A: preg_replace had a parameter added in PHP 4.0.2 that Smarty
   requires. Upgrade to at least 4.0.4pl to fix all known PHP issues with
   Smarty.

Q: I get the following error when running Smarty:
   Fatal error: Failed opening required 'PEAR.php'
   (include_path='c:\inetpub\wwwroot\intra\php') in Config_File.class.php on
   line 3
A: The pear libraries come bundled with PHP. In Unix, the default location
   is in /usr/local/lib/php/. On Windows, it is under
   the directory you installed PHP, probably c:/php/pear/.
   Locate these files and add this directory to your php_include path.
