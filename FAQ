TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

Q: Smarty doesn't work.
A: You must be using PHP 4.0.4pl1 or later to fix all known problems
   Smarty has with PHP. Read the BUGS section of the documentation.

Q: Smarty is recompiling my templates on every invocation.
A: This is a bug that was fixed in 1.0a, grab the latest tarball.

Q: I get the following error when running Smarty:
   Warning: Wrong parameter count for preg_replace() in
   Smarty.class.php on line 371
A: preg_replace had a parameter added in PHP 4.0.2 that Smarty
   requires. Upgrade to at least 4.0.4pl to fix all known PHP issues with
   Smarty.

Q: I get the following error when running Smarty:
   Fatal error: Failed opening required 'PEAR.php'
   (include_path='') in Config_File.class.php on line 3
A: Smarty uses the PEAR libraries for some of its error handling routines.
   PEAR libraries come with the distribution of PHP. Be sure that the path to
   these libraries is included in your php include_path. Unix users check
   /usr/local/lib/php. Windows users check C:/php/pear.
