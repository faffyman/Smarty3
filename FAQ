Q: Smarty is recompiling my templates on every invocation.
A: This is a bug that was fixed, grab the latest tarball.

Q: I get the following error when running Smarty:
   Warning: Wrong parameter count for preg_replace() in
   Smarty.class.php on line 371
A: preg_replace had a parameter added in PHP 4.0.2 that Smarty
   requires. Upgrade to at least 4.0.4pl to fix all PHP issues with
   Smarty.
