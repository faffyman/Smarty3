DESCRIPTION:

    What is Smarty?

	Smarty is a template engine for PHP. Many other template engines for PHP
	provide basic variable substitution and dynamic block functionality. Smarty
	takes a step further to be a "smart" template engine, adding features such
	as configuration files, template functions, and variable modifiers, and
	making all of this functionality as easy as possible to use for both
	programmers and template designers. Smarty also converts the templates into
	PHP scripts, eliminating the need to parse the templates on every
	invocation. This makes Smarty extremely scalable and managable for large
	application needs.

    Some of Smarty's features:

    * it is extremely fast
    * it is relatively simple since the PHP parser does the dirty work.
    * no template parsing overhead, only compiles once.
    * it is smart about recompiling only the template
      files that have changed.
    * you can make custom functions and custom variable modifiers, so
      the template language is extremely extensible.
    * configurable template delimiter tag syntax, so you can use
      {}, {{}}, <!--{}-->, or whatever you like.
    * template if/elseif/else/endif constructs are passed to the PHP parser,
      so the if syntax can be as simple or as complex as you like.
    * unlimited nesting of sections, ifs, etc. allowed
    * it is possible to imbed PHP code right in your template files,
      although not recommended and doubtfully needed since the engine
      is so customizable.
    * built in caching
    * arbitrary template sources (flat files, databases, etc.)
