SYNOPSIS:

    require("Smarty.class.php");

    $smarty = new Smarty;

    $smarty->assign("Title","My Homepage");
    $smarty->assign("Names",array("John","Gary","Gregg","James"));

    $smarty->display("./templates/index.tpl");

DESCRIPTION:

    What is Smarty?

    Smarty is a template engine for PHP. One of the unique aspects about
    Smarty that sets it apart from other templating solutions is that it
    compiles the templates into native php scripts upon the first
    execution. After that, it just executes the compiled PHP scripts.
    Therefore, there is no costly template file parsing for each request.

    Some of Smarty's features:

    * it is extremely fast
    * it is relatively simple since the PHP parser does the dirty work.
    * no template parsing overhead, only compiles once.
    * it is smart about recompiling only the template
      files that have changed.
    * you can make custom functions and custom variable modifiers, so
      the template language is extremely extensible.
    * configurable template delimiter tag syntax, so you can use
      {}, {{}}, <!--{}-->, or whatever you like.
    * template if/elseif/else/endif constructs are passed to the PHP parser,
      so the if syntax can be as simple or as complex as you like.
    * unlimited nesting of sections,ifs, etc. allowed
    * it is possible to imbed PHP code right in your template files,
      although not recommended and doubtfully needed since the engine
      is so customizable.
