"I just got my first paying contract for a local small business and in my
 program I'm using Smarty. Smarty is an absolute joy to work with -
 at first, I didn't like the idea of populating variables/arrays and then
 assigning those directly (since I'd been using FastTemplates for so long),
 but after using this system for a while, I don't think I can ever go back
 (I even switched my Perl template engine to HTML-Template-2.4 which
 operates on the same concepts).  Anyway, thanks for saving me time and
 headache!"
