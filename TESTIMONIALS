"I just got my first paying contract for a local small business and in my
 program I'm using Smarty. Smarty is an absolute joy to work with -
 at first, I didn't like the idea of populating variables/arrays and then
 assigning those directly (since I'd been using FastTemplates for so long),
 but after using this system for a while, I don't think I can ever go back
 (I even switched my Perl template engine to HTML-Template-2.4 which
 operates on the same concepts).  Anyway, thanks for saving me time and
 headache!"

"Smarty is usually described as 'complex', I can testify this is not true. What
is true is that the Smarty learning curve is longer than any other stuff, but on
the other side Smarty is the one and only system that allows a single guy to
build and manage a website with hundreds of templates, sophisticated user
management, editorial publishing and a lot of other stuff without any problem.

I tried a lot of other solutions, I tried to extend prepackaged solutions  (the
famous nuke-like family).. nothing comes close to Smarty.

And about the 'complex' aspect.. I'm not even a developer. I became a 
so-called one because of my site but in reality I'm not a developer."
