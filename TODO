* Ability to load multiple sections in one {config_load ...}
* do way with Smarty.addons.php and make drop-in plugin
  directory for functions and modifiers
* handle asp style tags in $php_handler
* correctly capture nested php tag syntax in templates:
  <?php echo "<?php exit(); ?>"; ?>
* think about passing default structures to includes, i.e. {include
  default=$foo}, then using $bar in included template, instead of $foo.bar
